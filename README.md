im Ricky, just turned 13, and im an aspiring fullstack developer.

i only code on weekdends since my mom said i cannot have screentime on weekdays. she said screentime is very dangerous for eyes. i hope one day i get to be a popular dev and i can work on weekdays and i can build a github streak ðŸ˜­

btw i got screentime today Sep 4th because its my birthday!!!!
